**Participate in code or document contribution：**

- `Fork`，fork the project to your Github account;
- `Clone`，clone the project to the local development environment;
- `Hack`，hacking code or documents (create a new branch to complete the update);
- `Push`，push the committed branch to the remote Github account;
- `PR`，create a new pull request to complete the contribution;

- `Community node building:`Create a Simplechain node and expose the IP address and port number to the public for community developers to use directly.
- `Active technical community:`Guide topics in the technology community and activate the atmosphere of the technology community (such as Weibo Super Talk)

**Community project contribution**

There are mainly two forms of contribution to participating in community projects;

- Developers can choose their own development based on Simplechain. There is no need to communicate with the official, and there is no incentive for this. It is purely a personal behavior of community developers and has nothing to do with the Simplechain technology community.

- Developers think that a certain basic tool is necessary for the development of Simplechain, but it is not yet available. It can be fed back to the person in charge of the technical community, and the technical personnel think it is necessary after evaluation. Then it can be developed, and developers will also get certain token incentives.
